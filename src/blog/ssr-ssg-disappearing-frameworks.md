When I first heard the term **“disappearing frameworks”**, I paused. Was this another buzzword? Or something real?

Turns out — it’s very real. And it’s reshaping how we build frontend applications in 2025.

## 🔁 SSR vs SSG: A Quick Refresher

- **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)**: Your pages are rendered on-the-fly when users request them.
- **SSG (Static Site Generation)**: Pages are pre-built during the build step — super fast at runtime.
- **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)**: Mix of both — used by frameworks like Next.js.

In 2020, this was the hot debate. But fast-forward to today...

## 🚀 Enter “Disappearing Frameworks”

Frameworks like **Astro** and **Qwik** are turning heads because they:
- Ship almost **no JavaScript** to the browser by default
- Use **island architecture** (hydrate only interactive parts)
- Or **resume** the app state instead of reloading it (Qwik’s approach)

This is what we mean by “disappearing” — they fade out of the way after build, leaving you with fast, minimal pages.

## ⚔️ Framework Showdown

| Feature            | Astro            | Qwik             | Next.js (App Router) |
|--------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| Default Strategy   | SSG              | Resumability     | SSR / ISR / RSC       |
| JS by default      | 0 KB (HTML only) | Lazy resume      | Depends (RSC helps)   |
| Ideal Use          | Blogs, Docs      | High perf apps   | Full-stack apps       |
| Learning Curve     | Low              | Medium–High      | Medium                |

## 🧪 Real Dev Use Case

I recently tested Astro vs Qwik for a simple marketing site:
- **Astro** loaded in ~0.8s with no JS
- **Qwik** resumed instantly, even with interactivity
- **Next.js** (without tuning) felt heavier on cold loads

Does that mean Next.js is dead? No. But it’s time to rethink **where** we use what.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

2025 is not about “which is better.”

It’s about **choosing the right rendering strategy per route**:
- Use **Astro** for blogs/docs/static content
- Use **Qwik** for interactive dashboards or widgets
- Use **Next.js** if you need full-stack + flexibility

If you're a frontend dev looking to **speed up your site**, reduce JS, and adopt modern techniques — now's the best time to explore Astro and Qwik.
